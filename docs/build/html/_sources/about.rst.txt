About QuantumTransport
======================

QuantumTransport is a package for calculating electron spin polarization and 
transmission of a molecular junction system. Calculations of electron
transmission through a molecule (central region) connected to (semi-infinite)
contacts (left and right electrodes) are based on the non-self-consistent
Green’s function method, an approximation to the non-equilibrium Green’s
function (NEGF) method.

Spin polarization in the electron transmission of closed- and open shell
systems (such as radicals or diradicals) can be performed by interfacing with
electronic structure packages. For closed-shell systems, it requires
electronic structure calculations taking spin−orbit coupling (SOC) into
account.  Greeen's functions of the left and right electrodes are approximated
within the wide-band limit, using a constant local density of states, cLDOS.
Coupling terms of electrodes are neglected.
